    "Also known as \"Noughts and Crosses\". The roots of this game can be traced back to ancient Egyp, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BCE. It was also one of the first computer games; In 1952, ritish computer scientist Alexander S. Douglas developed OXO (or Noughts and Crosses) for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge. His implememntation used MinMax and was able to play a perfect game against a human oponent.\n",
